. \[*WAFR'24*\] _Dongjie Yu\*_, Hang Xu\*, Yizhou Chen, Yi Ren and Jia Pan. "BiKC: Keypose-Conditioned Consistency Policy for Bimanual Robotic Manipulatio". In /The 16th International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics/, 2024.
.. tldr: We present Bimanual Keypose-Conditioned Consistency Policy (BiKC) to enhance the operational reliability and eï¬ƒciency by overcoming per-stage error and per-step latency accumulated across multiple stages.

.. tldr: We characterize feasible sets (persistently safe states) with Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis in constrained RL. The algorithm reachs a zero-violation policy with competitive performance.

=== Journal papers
. \[*T-ASE*\] _Dongjie Yu\*_, Wenjun Zou, Yujie Yang, Haitong Ma, Shengbo Eben Li, Yuming Yin, Jianyu Chen and Jingliang Duan. "Safe Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with an Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Certificate". /IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering/, DOI: 10.1109/TASE.2023.3292388, 2023.
.. tldr: We propose a distributional form of reachability certificate to consider the uncertaity of the system dynamics in safe RL. The algorithm is able to learn a zero-violation policy with competitive performance, significantly reducing violations during exploration.
