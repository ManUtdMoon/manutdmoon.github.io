== Brief Introduction

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong, fortunately advised by [https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/jpan Prof. Jia Pan]. Now I am working on robot learning approaches, especially imitation learning, for manipulation tasks.

Before that, I received the M.S. and B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Vehicle and Mobility from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2023 and 2020, respectively.
At THU, I was supervised by [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shengbo-Li-2 Prof. Shengbo Li] who leads [http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/index.html iDLab], working on reinforcement learning applied in autonomous driving. I also collabrated with [http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/ Prof. Jianyu Chen], who leads the Intelligent System and Robotics Lab at Institute of Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. During my time as a Master student, I was interested in reinforcement learning (RL) combined with optimal control, especially safe RL (where agents should not violate certain state constraints during and/or after the learning process), and their applications to autonomous driving and robotics.
